# Scratch Advertisement Reporter

This simple script loops through projects on Scratch's trending page and reports any advertisement comments that it sees (using scratchattach).

The default is 16 projects and 30 comments per project, but you can customize how many projects / comments it loops through.
To customize it, replace the 16 and 30 in `report(16,30)`

Replace `"username"` and `"password"` with your Scratch login.
